# Producer-Consumer-Problem-using-Multi-Threading-
This project demonstrates the classical Producer–Consumer synchronization problem implemented using multi-threading. The problem models a real-world scenario where one or more producer threads generate data and place it into a shared bounded buffer, while one or more consumer threads remove and process that data concurrently.
